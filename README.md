# PristineRepo

## Overview

This repo contains a high-performance suite of tools (ExoSuite), which is comprised of multiple Patent-pending cryptography tools. The component engines: PrimeEngineAI, FactorEngine, QuantumHash, and the Layered Symbolic Cache engine that controls the orchestration and symbiotic functions of/for the entire ExoSuite ecosystem, were designed with speed, accuracy, power, intellegence and the Paretto Efficiency principles as the blueprint for this suite. ExoSuite leverages **symbolic filtering**, **GPU-accelerated sieving**, **Intellegent Layered Symbolic Caching** and **probabilistic validation** to optimize computational efficiency; it systematically eliminates all unnecessary candidates before running intensive primality tests. This lowers compute time and cost substantially. Designed for cryptographic applications, mathematical research, and high-speed numeric processing, ExoSuite is the fastest, most powerful self-learning suite of its kind, and the only suite that can reach numbersets 10^500 and higher.

## Features

- **Symbolic Filtering & Truncation** – Excludes non-prime candidates early based on digit structure and modular arithmetic.
- **GPU-Accelerated Sieving** – Uses CUDA to parallelize composite detection.
- **Infinitesimal Remainder Analysis** – Lightweight heuristic filters before deeper validation.
- **GMP Miller-Rabin Primality Testing** – Probabilistic validation with deterministic fallback (ECPP for large numbers).
- **Modular Architecture** – Each pipeline stage operates independently for extensibility.
- **Machine Learning Hooks** – Adaptive filtering using ML-assisted symbolic rule evolution.
- **Cloud-Optimized Deployment** – Containerized infrastructure for scalable compute environments.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- CUDA-enabled GPU (optional for acceleration)
- GMP library for large-number arithmetic
- Docker (recommended for containerized deployments)

### Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/PristineRepo/PristineRepo.git
cd PristineRepo
pip install -r requirements.txt
