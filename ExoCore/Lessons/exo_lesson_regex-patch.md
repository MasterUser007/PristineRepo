**Lesson ID**: LSN-REGEX-PATCH  
**Date**: 2025-06-26  
**Result**: Regex escape error corrected in cloudseed.ps1  

---

### ‚ùå Issue

Previous pattern in xo_evolve.ps1 caused a PowerShell error:

    Invalid pattern '\' at offset 1. Illegal \ at end of pattern.

The regex string "\" was misinterpreted due to an invalid escape sequence.

---

### ‚úÖ Resolution

- Replaced "\" with '\' (single-quoted)
- Avoided misinterpretation by the regex engine
- Preserved detection of $region reference in file content

---

### üß† Reflection

Even cognitive agents need to lint their own syntax. This patch prevents build-time failures due to faulty pattern logic and helps future cognition guard against misquoted regex checks.
