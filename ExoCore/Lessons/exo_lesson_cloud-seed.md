### üß± Provisioned Components

- **S3 Bucket**: `exocore-memory`  
  - Versioning: Enabled  
  - Lifecycle: Telemetry transitions to STANDARD_IA after 90 days  
- **CloudWatch Log Group**: `/ExoCore/Cognition`  

### üõ° IAM Roles

- `ExoLearner`  
  - Permissions: S3 (R/W), CloudWatch Logs (Write)  
  - Trust: `ec2.amazonaws.com`

- `ExoDeployer`  
  - Permissions: CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CloudFormation, IAM PassRole  
  - Trust: `ec2.amazonaws.com`

---

### üîç Reasoning

- Memory durability, role separation, and telemetry routing support Exo's reflexive cognition  
- Minimal trust scope (EC2) to constrain access vectors  
- All components reproducible via `cloudseed.ps1`

---

### üß≠ Next Suggestions

- Wire ARNs into MappingTree as known primitives  
- Reuse `cloudseed.ps1` for future infra mutation tracking  
- Refactor lesson into `exo-learn.ps1` auto-ingestion process
