**Lesson ID**: LSN-ENGINEHARNESS-PATCH  
**Date**: 2025-06-26  
**Result**: Loop logic corrected in engine-harness.ps1, forecast, and selftest scripts  

---

### ‚ùå Issue

Backslash placeholders (\) remained from templating stubs in engine loops:
- oreach (\ in \)
- if (-not \)
- Unreadable iteration logic

---

### ‚úÖ Resolution

- Substituted proper variable and loop names  
- Harness now reads from DataLabManifest.json  
- orecast and selftest run cleanly  

---

### üß† Reflection

This patch clears symbolic noise that obstructed cognition routing. From now on, loop syntax is monitored for malformed constructs during reflex.
