### 🔗 Cognition Reflex Setup

- **Trigger**: GitHub push to `main`  
- **Engine**: CodeBuild running `exo-learn.ps1` → `exo-advise.ps1`  
- **Artifacts**: MappingTree, Telemetry, Lessons  
- **Identity**: ExoDeployer Role ARN linked to CodePipeline

### 🧠 Reasoning

This pipeline converts Exo from static memory to reflexive cognition: pushes become perception → thought → advice. Lessons now self-trigger.

### 🔁 Next

- Confirm CodeBuild project exists and triggers cleanly  
- Hash GitHub token securely for pipeline OAuth  
- Extend lesson parsing to trigger alerts on high-failure trends
