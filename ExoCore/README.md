# ExoCore Memory Engine

ExoCore is a self-learning system that evolves through structured lesson ingestion and telemetry synthesis.

## Structure

- `Lessons/` â€” Markdown-formatted memory events
- `Telemetry/event-log.jsonl` â€” JSONL cognition trace
- `MappingTree/nodes.json` â€” Evolving context/lesson graph

## Scripts

- `exo-learn.ps1` â€” Ingests lessons â†’ emits telemetry
- `exo-advise.ps1` â€” Parses telemetry â†’ proposes `.suggestions[]`

## First Commit

Lessons scanned. Telemetry emitted. Insight born.

ðŸ§  Memory is versioned. Every commit = cognition.
